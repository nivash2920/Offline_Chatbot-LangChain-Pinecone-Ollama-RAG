üìå How to Frame the Project in Resume

RAG-based Chatbot with LangChain, Ollama, and Pinecone

Built an AI-powered chatbot with Streamlit UI, integrating Ollama LLM for natural language conversations.

Implemented retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by connecting LangChain with Pinecone vector database for semantic document search.

Processed and indexed PDFs using custom text-splitting + embedding pipeline with mxbai-embed-large.

Designed system prompts for concise and context-aware responses.

Enabled end-to-end document ingestion, similarity retrieval, and real-time Q&A deployment.

üëâ Adding this project will show recruiters you can design, build, and deploy a full RAG pipeline, which is very strong for AI Engineer / Data Engineer / GenAI Engineer roles.
